ðŸ“Œ Java Exercise: Singleton Pattern Logger
This exercise demonstrates the Singleton Design Pattern using a Logger class that ensures only one instance is created throughout the program.

Features:
- Implements the Singleton design pattern.
- Logs messages with timestamps.
- Confirms single instance reuse across different calls.
Files:
- Logger.java â†’ Singleton class.
- Main.java   â†’ Test class to demonstrate functionality.

Sample Output:
[2025-06-18 20:15:22] Logging: First log message
[2025-06-18 20:15:22] Logging: Second log message
Logger instances same? true

Concepts Used:
- Static instance variable
- Private constructor
- Public static `getInstance()` method

 Additional Ideas:
- Extend to log to a file
- Use logger in other exercises
