 Step 1: Why DSA Matters
Why Data Structures & Algorithms?
Efficient inventory systems must:

Allow fast product lookup (e.g., by ID)

Handle large datasets dynamically

Avoid redundancy and enable quick updates/deletions

Best Data Structure:
HashMap<String, Product> is ideal for:

Constant-time lookup, update, and delete (O(1) average case)

Fast access by productId (key)
