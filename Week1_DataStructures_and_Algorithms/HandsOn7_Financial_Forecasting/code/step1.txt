Step 1: Why Use Recursion?
Recursion breaks a complex problem (predicting compound growth over multiple years) into smaller subproblems.

Ideal for problems where current output depends on previous result.

 Formula:
Future Value = Present Value * (1 + Growth Rate)^Years
We'll use recursion to implement exponentiation and calculate the compounded growth.
