# Java Deep Skilling Hands-On Projects – Cognizant Nurture 4.0

This repository contains Java-based hands-on exercises developed as part of **Cognizant Digital Nurture 4.0 – Deep Skilling Program**. The work is categorized under two main domains:

- **Week 1: Design Principles and Patterns**
- **Week 2: Data Structures and Algorithms**

Each domain consists of multiple structured exercises that demonstrate real-world implementation of OOP, design patterns, data structures, algorithm optimization, and interactive Java applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java SE 8+
- OOP Principles
- Collections Framework
- Design Patterns
- CLI Interactivity (Scanner)

## 📌 How to Run

```bash
javac *.java
java MainClassName  # Replace with the main file name like StrategyPatternDemo
```
Each folder has a designated main file (like `SingletonPatternDemo.java`, `StrategyPatternDemo.java`, etc.)
