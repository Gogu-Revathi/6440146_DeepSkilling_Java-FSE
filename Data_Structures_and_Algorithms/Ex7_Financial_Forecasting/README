ðŸ“Œ Java Exercise: Financial Forecasting Using Recursion

Description:
Forecasts future value of an investment using a recursive formula based on the compound interest model.

 Features:
- Accepts present value, rate, and duration
- Uses recursion to compute FV = PV Ã— (1 + r)^n
- Handles input with validation
- Provides time complexity analysis

 Files:
- FinancialForecast.java â†’ Main recursive app

 Sample Output:
 Enter Present Value (â‚¹): 10000
 Enter Annual Growth Rate (%): 10
 Enter Number of Years: 3
 Future Value after 3 years: â‚¹13,310.00
 Time Complexity: O(n)

 Concepts Used:
- Recursion
- Mathematical modeling
- try-with-resources
- Decimal formatting

 Optimization Tip:
Use memoization or iteration for large n to reduce call stack usage.
