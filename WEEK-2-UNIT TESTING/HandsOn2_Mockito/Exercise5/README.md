Exercise 5: Mocking and Stubbing with Multiple Returns 
Scenario: 
You need to test a service that depends on an external API with multiple return values. 
Steps: 
1. Create a mock object for the external API. 
2. Stub the methods to return different values on consecutive calls. 
3. Write a test case that uses the mock object.
